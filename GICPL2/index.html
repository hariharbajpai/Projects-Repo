  <h2>History of GICPL</h2>
  <p>
    <i>
      "GICPL traces its humble origins to the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic in June-July 2020. What began as a small-scale initiative at the corner of the GIC ground with just 8 to 10 participants and teams of 4 to 5 members each, soon evolved into a celebrated sporting tradition. The league kicked off with a street-side 7-match series between two rival teams: NKT, led by Fr. Nikhil Yadav, and SKS, captained by Fr. Abhay Shukla. The inaugural season was a closely contested affair, ending with a 4-3 victory for NKT, marking the beginning of a fierce and enduring rivalry between the two teams. The following season, SKS made a remarkable comeback under Fr. Abhay Shukla's leadership, leveling the stakes and intensifying the competition.
      <br>
      As the league grew in popularity, it was decided that an auction system would be introduced to add a new dimension to the game. The first official auction was held between Sahar ke Shaampoo, led by Fr. Sahar Pathak, and Ansh ke Ande, captained by Fr. Ansh Agarwal. This marked a turning point in GICPL's history, as the league began to adopt a more professional structure. Over time, GICPL expanded to include auctions, press conferences, gala dinners for the winning team, and dedicated media and content teams. The league also appointed a treasurer and accumulated sufficient funds to secure grounds for its matches, a testament to its growth and success.
      <br>
      The foundation of GICPL's success lies in the unwavering dedication of its pioneers—Fr. Nikhil Yadav, Fr. Sahar Pathak, Fr. Abhay Shukla, Fr. Aryan Agarwal, and Fr. Ansh Agarwal—and the relentless efforts of its players. Today, GICPL conducts two seasons annually: the main season during Diwali, featuring the iconic NKT vs. SKS rivalry, and GICPL-H, where new captains are chosen, and auctions are held for every edition. Looking ahead, GICPL is set to introduce leather ball matches under proper ICC rules starting from GICPL-H 2025, further elevating the league's stature.
      <br>
      At its core, the never-ending rivalry between NKT and SKS remains the heart and soul of GICPL, a testament to the passion and spirit of the game. As the league continues to grow, it carries forward the legacy of its forefathers, ensuring that the spirit of competition and camaraderie endures for generations to come"
